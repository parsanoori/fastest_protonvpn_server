# Fastest ProtonVPN server finder

This repo simply uses what the Proton-CLI uses to find the fastest server from the free servers of ProtonVPN.  

## Usage

1. Fill `username` and `password` in the `main.py`.
2. Optional: Change the default proxy in the line 35 of `main.py`
3. Just run `./main.py` and have fun. 
For further use consider that the first argument sets the number of servers to report the second sepcifies the country(only "US" and "NL" and "JP" for free version) and the last arguemnt sets the proxy.
